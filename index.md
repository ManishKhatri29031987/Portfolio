## Project 1:
Predicting_Employee_Retention_MANISH_MANOJ_MANTHAN
IIIT Bangalore Logistic regression assignment

A mid-sized technology company wants to improve its understanding of employee retention to foster a loyal and committed workforce. While the organization has traditionally focused on addressing turnover, it recognizes the value of proactively identifying employees likely to stay and understanding the factors contributing to their loyalty. In this assignment we will be building a logistic regression model to predict the likelihood of employee retention based on the data such as demographic details, job satisfaction scores, performance metrics, and tenure. The aim is to provide the HR department with actionable insights to strengthen retention strategies, create a supportive work environment, and increase the overall stability and satisfaction of the workforce.

## Project 2:

Bike Multi Linear Regression
IIIT Bangalore Linear Regression assignment

A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

We are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations.
